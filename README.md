# Project Title: BigSales Mart Data Analysis and Modeling

Project Description:

I used the BigSales Mart dataset to perform data preprocessing, data analysis, and modeling. I used Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, Matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for modeling.

I first cleaned the data by removing any missing values or outliers. I then performed feature engineering by creating new features from the existing features. I used a variety of data visualization techniques to explore the data and identify any trends or patterns.

I then trained a linear regression model and a random forest regression model on the data. The linear regression model performed well, but the random forest regression model performed better. This is likely because the random forest regression model is able to capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

The results of this project show that the BigSales Mart dataset is a valuable resource for data analysis and modeling. The data can be used to understand customer behavior, identify trends, and develop marketing campaigns.
